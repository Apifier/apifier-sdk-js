import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';

In this lesson, you will write your first crawler. But before you do, let's briefly introduce the Crawlee classes involved in the process.

## How Crawlee works

There are 3 main crawler classes available for use in Crawlee. <ApiLink to="cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler">`CheerioCrawler`</ApiLink>, <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="playwright-crawler/class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>. We'll talk about their differences later. Now, let's talk about what they have in common.

The general idea of each crawler is to go to a web page, open it, do some stuff there, save some results, continue to the next page, and repeat this process until the crawler's done its job. So the crawler always needs to find answers to two questions: **Where should I go?** and **What should I do there?** Answering those two questions is the only required setup. The crawlers have reasonable defaults for everything else.

### The Where - `Request` and `RequestQueue`

All crawlers use instances of the <ApiLink to="core/class/Request">`Request`</ApiLink> class to determine where they need to go. Each request may hold a lot of information, but at the very least, it must hold a URL - a web page to open. But having only one URL would not make sense for crawling. Sometimes you have a pre-existing list of your own URLs that you wish to visit, perhaps a thousand. Other times you need to build this list dynamically as you crawl, adding more and more URLs to the list as you progress. Most of the time, you will use both options.

The requests are stored in a <ApiLink to="core/class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink>, a dynamic queue of `Request` instances. You can seed it with start URLs and also add more requests while the crawler is running. This allows the crawler to open one page, extract interesting URLs, such as links to other pages on the same domain, add them to the queue (called _enqueuing_) and repeat this process to build a queue of virtually unlimited number of URLs.

### The What - `requestHandler`

In the `requestHandler` you tell the crawler what to do at each and every page it visits. You can use it to handle extraction of data from the page, processing the data, saving it, calling APIs, doing calculations and so on.

The `requestHandler` is a user-defined function, invoked automatically by the crawler for each `Request` from the `RequestQueue`. It always receives a single argument - a <ApiLink to="core/interface/CrawlingContext">`CrawlingContext`</ApiLink>. Its properties change depending on the crawler class used, but it always includes the `request` property, which represents the currently crawled URL and related metadata.

## Picking a crawler

Let's put the theory into practice and start with something super easy. Visit a page and get its title. In this tutorial, you'll scrape the Crawlee website [https://crawlee.dev](https://crawlee.dev), but the same code will work for any website. It's time to pick a crawler.

Crawlee comes with three main crawler classes

```ts
import { RequestQueue } from 'crawlee';

// First you create the request queue instance.
const requestQueue = await RequestQueue.open();
// And then you add a request to it.
await requestQueue.addRequest({ url: 'https://apify.com' });
```

> If you're not familiar with the `async` and `await` keywords used in the example, you should know that these are native syntax in modern JavaScript. You can [learn more about them here](https://nikgrozev.com/2017/10/01/async-await/).

The <ApiLink to="core/class/RequestQueue#addRequest">`requestQueue.addRequest()`</ApiLink> function automatically converts the plain object you passed to it to a `Request` instance, so now you have a `requestQueue` that holds one `request` which points to `https://apify.com`. In case you want to add more requests, you can also use the <ApiLink to="core/class/RequestQueue#addRequests">`requestQueue.addRequests()`</ApiLink> method, that accepts an array of request-like objects (or directly an array of strings - the URLs). Even better, there is a `crawler.addRequests()` method we will describe later in the tutorial - for now just keep in mind that the `crawler.addRequests()` is the smartest method of those three, because it supports adding large numbers of requests without blocking.

Now you need the `requestHandler`.

```ts
// Type import, applies only to TypeScript projects.
import type { CheerioCrawlingContext } from 'crawlee';

// We'll define the function separately, so it's more obvious.
const requestHandler: CheerioCrawlingContext = async ({ request, $ }) => {
    // This should look familiar if you ever worked with jQuery.
    // We're just getting the text content of the <title> HTML element.
    const title = $('title').text();

    console.log(`The title of "${request.url}" is: ${title}.`);
};
```

Wait, where did the `$` come from? Remember what you learned about the `requestHandler` earlier. It accepts a plain `Object` as an argument that will always have a `request` property, but it will also have other properties, depending on the chosen crawler class. Well, `$` is a property provided by the `CheerioCrawler` class, which we'll set up right now.

```ts
import { CheerioCrawler, RequestQueue, CheerioCrawlingContext } from 'crawlee';

const requestQueue = await RequestQueue.open();
await requestQueue.addRequests(['https://apify.com']);

const requestHandler: CheerioCrawlingContext = async ({ request, $ }) => {
    const title = $('title').text();
    console.log(`The title of "${request.url}" is: ${title}.`);
};

// Set up the crawler, passing a single options object as an argument.
const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    requestQueue,
    requestHandler,
});

await crawler.run();
```

That starts to look almost good. Almost? Yes, you can do even better! Every crawler has an implicit `RequestQueue` instance, so you can save yourself from all the `RequestQueue` related code and just use `crawler.addRequests()` method. In fact, you can even go further and just use the first parameter of `crawler.run()`! You can also move the `requestHandler` method definition directly to the crawler options, this way you get type inference for free:

```ts
import { CheerioCrawler } from 'crawlee';

// Set up the crawler, passing a single options object as an argument.
const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ request, $ }) {
        const title = $('title').text();
        console.log(`The title of "${request.url}" is: ${title}.`);
    },
});

// Enqueue the initial request and run the crawler
await crawler.run(['https://apify.com']);
```

And you're done! You just created your first crawler from scratch. It will download the HTML of `https://apify.com`, find the `<title>` element, get its text content and print it to console. Good job!

You should see the message `The title of "https://apify.com" is: Web Scraping, Data Extraction and Automation Â· Apify.` printed to the screen. If you do, congratulations and let's move onto some bigger challenges! And if you feel like you don't really know what just happened there, no worries, it will all become clear when you learn more about `CheerioCrawler`.

:::info

You are using a feature called [Top level await](https://blog.saeloun.com/2021/11/25/ecmascript-top-level-await.html) in your examples. To be able to use that, you might need some extra setup. Namely, it requires the use of [ECMAScript Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) - this means you either need to add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file, or use `*.mjs` extension for your files. Additionally, if you are in a TypeScript project, you need to set the `module` and `target` compiler options to `ES2022` or above.
