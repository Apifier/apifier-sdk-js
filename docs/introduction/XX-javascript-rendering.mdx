description: Your first steps into the world of scraping with Crawlee

TODO this is unlisted, need to figure out how to do this content since crawlee.dev is all server-side rendered. I had a bug in code which made me think it's not.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

import PlaywrightSource from '!!raw-loader!./XX-playwright.ts';
import PuppeteerSource from '!!raw-loader!./XX-puppeteer.ts';

In the previous lesson, you learned how to set up a very simple scraper that collects the `<title>` text from a page. In this lesson we'll teach you how to extract other elements using headless browsers.

## JavaScript rendering

JavaScript rendering is the process of executing JavaScript on the page to make changes in the page's structure. The Crawlee website uses JavaScript rendering to display some of its content. Let's confirm this with the example code from previous lesson. Change the extracted element to `h1`.

```ts title="src/main.mjs"
import { CheerioCrawler } from 'crawlee';

const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ $, request }) {
        // Extract the <h1> element instead of <title>.
        const title = $('h1').text();
        console.log(`The title of "${request.url}" is: ${title}.`);
    }
})

await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```

Run the code, and you'll see that the crawler won't print the content of the `h1` element.

```log
The title of "https://crawlee.dev" is: .
```

That's because the Crawlee website uses client-side JavaScript to render its content and `CheerioCrawler` can't render it, so the text cannot be extracted.

## Headless browsers

To get the `h1` element, you will have to use a headless browser. You can choose from two libraries to control your browser: [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) or [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright). The choice is simple. If you know one of them, choose the one you know. If you know both, or none, choose Playwright, because it's better in most cases.

No matter which library you pick, here's the example code for both. Notice that it's very similar to the earlier `CheerioCrawler` code.

<Tabs groupId="javascript-rendering">
    <TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js" title="src/main.mjs">{PlaywrightSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js" title="src/main.mjs">{PuppeteerSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
