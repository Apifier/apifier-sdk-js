Without the right tools, crawling and scraping the web can be difficult. At the very least, you need an HTTP client or a headless browser to make the necessary requests, but more often than not, you will get blocked by various anti-scraping protections. If you get past the protections undetected, you have to parse the HTML and extract the data you're interested in. Once extracted, you will store the data in a machine-readable format for further processing.

Crawlee covers the process end-to-end. Its crawlers appear human-like and fly under the radar of above-average bot protections even with the default configuration. But they are also customizable enough to pass even the strictest bot challenges. Crawlee gives you the tools to crawl the web for links, scrape data and persistently store it in machine-readable formats, without having to worry about the technical details. It helps you set up more robust and reliable crawlers in less time.

## What you will learn

The goal of the introduction is to provide a step-by-step guide to all the features of Crawlee. It will walk you through creating the simplest of crawlers that only prints text to console, all the way up to a full-featured scraper that collects links from a website and extracts data.
