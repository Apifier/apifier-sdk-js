import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';

&#8203;<ApiLink to="http-crawler/class/HttpCrawler">`HttpCrawler`</ApiLink> is our simplest and fastest crawler, as it doesn't do any HTML parsing. This enables us to attach any DOM engine of our choosing.

:::note

For starters, we recommend using <ApiLink to="cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler">`CheerioCrawler`</ApiLink> instead as it already comes with the old-school jQuery syntax. And it's **fast**.

## How the crawler works

&#8203;<ApiLink to="http-crawler/class/HttpCrawler">`HttpCrawler`</ApiLink> crawls by making plain HTTP requests to the provided URLs using the specialized [got-scraping](https://github.com/apify/got-scraping) HTTP client. The URLs are fed to the crawler using <ApiLink to="core/class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink>. The HTTP responses it gets back are usually HTML pages. The same pages you would get in your browser when you first load a URL. But it can handle any content types with the help of the <ApiLink to="http-crawler/interface/HttpCrawlerOptions#additionalMimeTypes">`additionalMimeTypes`</ApiLink> option.

:::info

Modern web pages often do not serve all of their content in the first HTML response, but rather the first HTML contains links to other resources such as CSS and JavaScript that get downloaded afterwards, and together they create the final page. To crawl those, see <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="playwright-crawler/class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>.

## When to use `HttpCrawler`

`HttpCrawler` really shines when you need to apply an additional layer on top of the page source code such as `JSDOM` or any DOM implementation in Node.js.

**Advantages:**

-   Extremely fast and cheap to run
-   Automatically avoids some anti-scraping bans

**Disadvantages:**

-   Requires intermediate knowledge about DOM implementations in Node.js
    -   Using an actual DOM implementation can be slower than `CheerioCrawler`
-   Does not work for websites that require JavaScript rendering
-   May easily overload the target website with requests
-   Does not enable any manipulation of the website before scraping

## Example use of `HttpCrawler`

### Set up JSDOM

Finds the first `<h2>` element and returns its text content.

```js
import { HttpCrawler, Dataset } from 'crawlee';
import { JSDOM } from 'jsdom';

const crawler = new HttpCrawler({
    requestHandler: async ({ body }) => {
        const { window } = new JSDOM(body);
        const textContent = window.document.querySelector('h2')?.textContent;

        await Dataset.pushData({ textContent, url: request.loadedUrl });
    },
});

await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```
